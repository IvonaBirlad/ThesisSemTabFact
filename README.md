#Table Statement Verification and Evidence Finding

This repository contains code for my SemEval20212 Task 9 approach within the context of my thesis project. The aim is to develop a system for table statement verification and evidence finding. The use case for this project is to promote proper interpretation of scientific articles by helping users understand the information presented in tables.

Two tasks are defined by the SemEval Task organizers: 

##Table Statement Support

The first subtask of this project is to determine whether a table supports a given statement. This will involve developing a method to analyze the table data and determine whether the statement is supported by the information presented.

##Relevant Cell Selection

The second subtask of this project is to identify the cells in the table that provide evidence for the statement. This will involve developing a method to analyze the table data and determine which cells contain the information needed to support the statement.

##Data

The data used for this project consists of tables from scientific articles and corresponding verification statements. Manually annotated data was made available to indicate which cells support a given statement which data will be used to train and evaluate the models developed as part of this project. Automatically generated annotations will also be added to supplement training data.
